Hello and welcome — we're delighted you're considering submitting to SCIE(NCE)! We accept a wide range of article types across Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics, Computer Science, and related areas. Submissions can include:

1. Formal research papers
2. Short or summarized research papers that highlight a single insight
3. Theoretical papers or idea sketches(Beyond IGCSE, Alevel, AP or IB syllabus; For physics, encouraged to be mathematical based)
4. Project reports (designs or experiments)
5. Engineering projects
6. Mathematical modelling studies
7. Programming or software projects
8. Anything that involves research, experiment or application- if you have any other ideas, please contact [SCIE(NCE)](about.qmd), we'll get in touch with you as soon as possible. 

We bring students together across campuses, cities, and countries to share projects, learn collaboratively, and encourage emerging investigators who are excited to explore new fields.

## Research/Project

These are engineering- or experiment-based submissions. We look for:

- Problem-solving projects that address a clear niche (e.g., "A Low-Cost Mesh Network for Campus Emergency Alerts").
- Failure analyses and negative results that include data and lessons learned.
- Reproducibility: documentation, materials, and files sufficient for others to reproduce the work.

## Theories

For theoretical work, focus on clear exposition of the idea, motivation, and implications. We welcome conceptual advances even without experimental validation; include illustrative calculations, simulations, or suggested tests when possible.

## Other accepted formats

- **Reviews:** concise overviews that synthesize literature and highlight open problems.
- **Tutorials / How‑To Guides:** step-by-step introductions, ideally with code or notebooks.
- **Software / Tools:** descriptions of code, libraries, or tools with repository links and usage examples.
- **Data Descriptors / Datasets:** curated datasets with metadata and reuse guidance.
- **Methods / Protocols:** detailed procedures others can reproduce.
- **Short Communications:** brief reports of a single important result or technique.
- **Replication / Negative Results:** repeat studies and well-documented null/negative outcomes.
- **Perspectives / Opinion Pieces:** informed commentary on directions, ethics, or trends.
- **Teaching Resources:** classroom-ready exercises or lab instructions.
- **Visual Essays:** illustrated explanations or infographics with captions and data.

## Submission guidance

- **Expectations:** suggest target lengths (e.g., short notes 500–1500 words; full articles 2,000–6,000 words) and whether a submission will undergo peer review.
- **Reproducibility:** include data, code, and a short README or runnable notebook when relevant.
- **Formats:** we accept QMD/Markdown, LaTeX/PDF manuscripts, figures, and supplementary archives. For software or data, include a stable repository link (e.g., GitHub, Zenodo) and a license.
