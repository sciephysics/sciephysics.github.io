Hello and welcome — we're delighted you're considering submitting to SCIE(NCE)! We accept a wide range of article types across Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics, Computer Science, and related areas. Submissions can include:

1. Formal research papers
2. Short or summarized research papers that highlight a single insight
3. Theoretical papers or idea sketches(Beyond IGCSE, Alevel, AP or IB syllabus; For physics, encouraged to be mathematical based)
4. Project reports (designs or experiments)
5. Engineering projects
6. Mathematical modelling studies
7. Programming or software projects
8. Anything that involves research, experiment or application- if you have any other ideas, please contact [SCIE(NCE)](about.qmd), we'll get in touch with you as soon as possible. 

We bring students together across campuses, cities, and countries to share projects, learn collaboratively, and encourage emerging investigators who are excited to explore new fields.

## Research/Project

These are engineering- or experiment-based submissions. We look for:

- Problem-solving projects that address a clear niche (e.g., "A Low-Cost Mesh Network for Campus Emergency Alerts").
- Failure analyses and negative results that include data and lessons learned.
- Reproducibility: documentation, materials, and files sufficient for others to reproduce the work.

## Theories

For theoretical work, focus on clear exposition of the idea, motivation, and implications. We welcome conceptual advances even without experimental validation; include illustrative calculations, simulations, or suggested tests when possible.

## Other accepted formats

For other accepted genre, we feel we do not have anything to add, but if you have any questions, [feel free to reach out to us](about.qmd)

## Submission guidance

- **Expectations:** suggest target lengths (e.g., short notes 500–1500 words; full articles 2,000–6,000 words) and whether a submission will undergo peer review.
- **Reproducibility:** include data, code, and a short README or runnable notebook when relevant.
- **Formats:** we accept QMD/Markdown, LaTeX/PDF manuscripts, figures, and supplementary archives. For software or data, include a stable repository link (e.g., GitHub, Zenodo) and a license.
